ABSTRACT

The  classification of traffic signs play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, contributing to road safety and efficiency. This project aims to develop a robust traffic sign classification system using machine learning techniques.

In this proposed project, we aim to develop a Vision-Based Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition System with additional functionalities tailored for the Indian context. The system will incorporate user authentication, voice feedback to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for drivers and traffic management personnel.

The project will leverage machine learning models, and natural language processing algorithms to detect and recognize traffic signs from images captured. A deep learning-based model will be trained on a dataset of traffic sign images to accurately classify and interpret various types of signs commonly found on roads.

The system will include a web-based interface for users to interact with the recognition system, receive voice feedback on detected signs.

In conclusion, this project seeks to contribute to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems by developing a reliable and efficient traffic sign classification system using machine learning techniques. The system’s ability to accurately recognize and interpret traffic signs from images can significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of road traffic, ultimately benefiting both drivers and pedestrians in diverse traffic scenarios.
